This is Barat, a front-end for Java.  It allows you to analyse Java
programs and do all sorts of fancy things with them.


  Installation
  ------------

Barat has been developed and tested with JDK1.2.2. It should run with
JDK1.2 or higher. Barat-1.3.4 is (probably) the last version which runs
with JDK1.1.

The directory in which you unpacked Barat is called Barat-x.y.z, where
x.y.z is the version number.  Let the absolute path to this directory
be TOPDIR.  To use Barat, add TOPDIR to your classpath and make sure
that "java -version" prints out JDK1.2 or higher.

Barat is written using the GJ generic Java compiler (but runs on any
standard JVM).  If you want to recompile Barat, you need this
compiler, and it is probably helpful if you use a GNU environment.
You can find GJ at http://www.cis.unisa.edu.au/~pizza/gj/Distribution/
(you need "GJ for use with JDK 1.2").

If you want to make changes to the grammar file (BaratParser.jj)
you will also need JavaCC 0.7.1 or 1.0, which you can find at
http://www.metamata.com .

The Makefiles in the Barat distribution require GNU make.

For parsing class files, Barat depends on BCEL, a library for
reading (and writing) Java byte code. BCEL is not included in
this distribution; please download BCEL.jar from:
  http://bcel.sourceforge.net/
(Note that BCEL is licensed using the Library GNU Public License.) 

Markus Dahm (dahm@inf.fu-berlin.de), the author of BCEL, has
written a code generator for Barat, i.e. an extendable Java compiler.
Please contact me or Markus if you are interested; the code generator
is currently licensed under the GNU Public License. It is not included
in this distribution.

  Usage and Documentation
  -----------------------

You can verify that Barat is installed correctly by executing 

  java barat.Barat <some class name>

Barat will parse the indicated class and write it back to standard
output in a "canonic" format.  NOTE: As Barat itself is written in
generic Java, it cannot parse its own source code.  If you don't have
any other Java program around, you can try it with

  java barat.Barat barat.reflect.AType

but don't feed it with any other source file from Barat itself.

To analyze Java programs, you will most likely use Barat as a
framework for higher level analysis tools.  There is a technical
report available which describes all of Barat's internals so that you
can use it for your own analyses.  The URL of the technical report is

  ftp://ftp.inf.fu-berlin.de/pub/reports/tr-b-98-09.pdf (or .ps.gz)

The code generator in package barat.codegen is *not* documented in
the technical report.

There are two new classes in the package barat, PreOrderWalker and
PostOrderWalker. These classes have been contributed by Jesper Steen
Moller <jesper@selskabet.org>.
