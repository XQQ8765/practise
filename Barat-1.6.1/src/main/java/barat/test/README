How the test "framework" works:
===============================

To compile all test classes:
----------------------------

> make
or
> javac Test*.java RunTests.java


To run the tests:
-----------------

> java barat.test.RunTests


To write a new test:
--------------------

Create a new test class in the package barat.test which has a name starting
with "Test" (e.g., "TestOutputVisitor" or "Test121846"). Each test class
should have a method
  public static void runTest()
which, when invoked, runs a test. The test is assumed to succeed if no
exception is thrown during the execution of runTest(). For a succeeding
test, both System.out and System.err are suppressed. In the failing
case, the output (out and err) is printed, followed by the stack trace
of the exception.
